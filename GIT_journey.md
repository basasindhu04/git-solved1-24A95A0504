##  Conflicts Resolved

###  Merge 1: `main` + `dev` (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: `config/app-config.yaml`
- **Issue**: Production used port 8080, development used 3000  
- **Resolution**: Created unified config with environment-based settings  
- **Strategy**: Keep production as default, add dev as optional  
- **Difficulty**: Medium  
- **Time**: 15 minutes  

#### Conflict 2: `config/database-config.json`
- **Issue**: Different database hosts and SSL modes  
- **Resolution**: Created separate profiles for production and development  
- **Strategy**: Restructured JSON to support both environments  
- **Difficulty**: Medium  
- **Time**: 10 minute 

#### Conflict 3: `scripts/deploy.sh`
- **Issue**: Different deployment strategies (production vs docker-compose)  
- **Resolution**: Added conditional logic based on DEPLOY_ENV variable  
- **Strategy**: Made script handle both environments dynamically  
- **Difficulty**: Hard  
- **Time**: 20 minutes  

#### Conflict 4: `scripts/monitor.js`
- **Issue**: Different monitoring intervals and log formats  
- **Resolution**: Environment-based configuration object  
- **Strategy**: Used process.env.NODE_ENV to determine behavior  
- **Difficulty**: Medium  
- **Time**: 15 minutes  

#### Conflict 5: `docs/architecture.md`
- **Issue**: Different architectural descriptions  
- **Resolution**: Merged both descriptions into comprehensive document  
- **Strategy**: Created sections for each environment  
- **Difficulty**: Easy  
- **Time**: 10 minutes  

#### Conflict 6: `README.md`
- **Issue**: Different feature lists and version numbers  
- **Resolution**: Combined all features with clear environment labels  
- **Strategy**: Organized features by category  
- **Difficulty**: Easy  
- **Time**: 10 minutes  

### Merge 2: `main` + `conflict-simulator` (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: `src/auth.js`
- **Issue**: Different login validation logic  
- **Resolution**: Unified logic with modular validation functions  
- **Strategy**: Created `validateUser()` and `validateToken()` methods  
- **Difficulty**: Medium  
- **Time**: 15 minutes  

#### Conflict 2: `src/api.js`
- **Issue**: Different API endpoint structures  
- **Resolution**: Refactored to use environment-based base URLs  
- **Strategy**: Used config file to determine base URL  
- **Difficulty**: Medium  
- **Time**: 10 minutes  

#### Conflict 3: `src/logger.js`
- **Issue**: Different logging formats and levels  
- **Resolution**: Created unified logger with configurable levels  
- **Strategy**: Used `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable  
- **Difficulty**: Medium  
- **Time**: 15 minutes  

#### Conflict 4: `tests/test-auth.js`
- **Issue**: Conflicting test cases for login  
- **Resolution**: Merged both test cases with conditional mocks  
- **Strategy**: Used Jest mock functions to simulate both flows  
- **Difficulty**: Hard  
- **Time**: 20 minutes  

#### Conflict 5: `docs/conflict-resolution.md`
- **Issue**: Different conflict resolution strategies  
- **Resolution**: Combined strategies into a best practices guide  
- **Strategy**: Created sections for manual vs automated resolution  
- **Difficulty**: Easy  
- **Time**: 10 minutes  

#### Conflict 6: `README.md`
- **Issue**: Conflicting instructions for setup  
- **Resolution**: Merged setup instructions with clear steps for each environment  
- **Strategy**: Added subsections for dev, test, and prod  
- **Difficulty**: Easy  
- **Time**: 10 minutes  

## Most Challenging Parts
1. Understanding conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)  
2. Choosing between conflicting code  
3. Resolving complex logic conflicts (`deploy.sh`)  
4. Testing after resolution  

## Key Learnings

### Technical Skills
- Mastered conflict resolution  
- Understood merge markers  
- Used `git diff` and `git log` effectively  
- Practiced advanced commands like `rebase`, `cherry-pick`, and `reflog`  

### Best Practices
- Always read both sides before resolving  
- Test before committing  
- Write clear commit messages  
- Use `git status` often  
- Commit in small, atomic units  

### Git Workflow Insights
- Conflicts are normal and manageable  
- Take time to understand changes  
- Ask for help when needed  
- Document your strategy  
- Stay calm and focused  

## Reflection
This challenge transformed my view of Git. Merge conflicts are no longer intimidatingâ€”they're just Git asking for guidance. I now feel confident resolving conflicts in real-world projects. The hands-on experience with advanced commands was invaluable, and learning to use `git reflog` saved me more than once!
